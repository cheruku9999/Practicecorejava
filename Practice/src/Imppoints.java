/*Java collections are Frameworks.
/Framework: To store and manipulate the groups of objects.

/Classes: Arraylist, Vector, Linkedlist, Hashset, Treeset, Priorityquee
/In java.util pacakage we will having all these classes


//implicitwait: wait for n number of seconds before you throw exception. It is global wise.
	//eg: if we give 5 seconds go wait, but page loads in 2 seconds is continues and doesnt wait for 5 seconds.
	//disadvantage:
	
	//explict wait: its applicable to particular element level only.
	//formatting of code: ctrl+shift+f
	//make sure class name starts with caps
	//variable name should always starts with small letters
	//sysout +ctrl+space: systemoutprintln
//if we want to write any reusable methods we should write outside of main block only.
//we can call a method without creating an object of that class, by making that method static.
