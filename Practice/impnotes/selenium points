//Testng and junit are unit test frameworks
//Purpose is to design test cases in a systamtic way

//There are 7 types of selectors
	
/*	
 
 
 
1)Xpath

//absoulute x-path should not be used eg: html/body/div[1]/div[5]/div[2]/a
//only relative xpath should be used eg: //*[@id='firstname']
 
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='firstname']")).sendKeys("tom");

2)id
driver.findElement(By.id("firstname")).sendKeys("tom");

3)name
driver.findElement(By.name("firstname")).sendKeys("tom");

4)linkText:this is only for links
driver.findElement(By.linkText("Sign in")).click;

5)partialLinkText: not such useful
driver.findElement(By.partialLink("how to pick")).click;

6)Cssselctor
//if id is there then css selector is----  #{id}
 
// if class is there then css selector is --  .{class}
 

driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#address1")).sendKeys("tom");

7)class name--not useful

driver.findElement(By.className("firstname")).sendKeys("tom");

**Very important
@CacheLookup--To improve the performance of the script. 
Advantages:
How it works:
1)Lets suppose the element is hitting the browser number of times to get the element path.There will be performance issues.
2)So if we use @CacheLookup for that element, there will be temporary memory created if we use @cachelookup.
3)So next time it will not go to browser every time it will taken from @cachelookup

Disadvantages:
1)Let see we are in homepage, if that page is refreshed then this cache memory will be corrupted. We will get stale element exception.
2)May be when dom model be changed in that case cache memory element will be staled or disturbed. 


//How to handly dropdown"
 
/by using select class. eg: 
 
 Select  select=new Select();
 
Select  select=new Select(driver.findElement(By.id(state)));

select.selectByVisiableText("California");


Html report in testng

how to get index.html file?
1)After execution of test we need to refresh the project everytime.
2)We will get testoutput folder inside this we will see index.html-->righclick copy the locaiton path and copy in any browser.


Advantages of Selenium:

1)It is on opensource
2)Supports various operating systems
3)supports various propgramming languages
4)supports various browser environment
5)supports parallel testing
6)uses less hardware resouces for automation
7)To avoid repetative tasks
8)

Disadvantages:
1)Supports only web applications
2)no reilable support from any one
3)new features may not work correctly
4)

WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver();  //for launching the browser. new ChromeDriver is child class object which is referred by parent interface reference variable (driver)
driver.get("http://www.google.com");   //for entering url
WebDriver driver1= new FirefoxDriver();
WebDriver driver1= new InternetExplorerDriver();

here WebDriver is parent class interface which is referred by child class object(new ChromeDriver()) with driver reference variable.

When do we get illegal state exception error?
Ans: when we launch the browser without setting up the system property of that browser
