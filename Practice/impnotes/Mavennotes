Assume there are 40 people working in project i have devlop a base framework and i want to share to other guys. But once took
into his local he have to again configure all the required jars in his local. And tomorrow the jars may get updated and
again we need to delete and configure new jars which is tedious task. Hence this is not good practice.
So to avoid that Maven has came into picture.

	1)Maven is central repository to get all dependencies
	2)Bascially we donot hardcode the jars in the project, we will get from maven, so that any one can download our project and can use.
	3)whenever we build project with manven configurations you need not provide any jars.
	4)Maven automatically connects to this website and looks what are the jars required.
	5)Downloads them and place it in project build path.
	6)So that's y we call project management tool and also build management tool


We need to pass the below 4 lines on xml tags into our project which we will get from maven repository

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.0-alpha-7</version>
</dependency>
1.maven identifies the selenium project uniquely using groupid. So basically it identifies the project uniqeuly.
2.artifact id is sub of group id. So its basically a name of the jar

****POM.XML is the heart of maven
to check the maven version

******
Maven Sure fire plugin is needed to execute all the test cases in maven project


whatever maven command we will execute we need to execute from project level. So we need to go that patch in cmd mode and needs to executes the cmds.
we can get the patch by right click on mavenproject-->properties-->copy the loaction. And navigate to that location in cmd.
maven commands
in cmd-->type mvn --version

mvn clean--->it will delete all temp files or builds whatever current prject have.
mvn compile-->it compiles all the code and see if there are any syntax errors.
mvn test-->will run the tests. IF WE GIVE DIRECTLY TEST WITHOUT CLEAN AND COMPILE, TEST WILL CLEAN AND COMPILE AUTOMATICALLY

** WHEN WE RUN MVC TEST, IT WILL FIRST CHECKS IN LOCAL FILE(.M2) WHICH AUTOMATICALLY CREATES. IF THE REQURED JARS ARE
NOT AVAIABLE THEN ONLY MAVEN GOES TO MAVEN REPOSITORY TO BRING THE REQUIRED JARS.

**by default maven expects the word Test at end of file.So that is the reason we have used test(appiumTest,restaapiTest,seleniumTest)
}

**we need to put this below code under surepire plug in poxml so that we can execute test from testng
<configuration>
          <suiteXmlFiles>
            <suiteXmlFile>testng.xml</suiteXmlFile> (the name testng is defalut name we must change based on name which we given in project level
          </suiteXmlFiles>
        </configuration>

**Profiles

<profiles>
<profile>
<id>regression</id>
  <build>
Profiles are used to decide which suite needs to be run whether smoke or regression. We need to put the reqruied testng xml file in the below code in pom.xml
1)
 <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>3.0.0-M5</version>
          <configuration>
          <suiteXmlFiles>
            <suiteXmlFile>testng2.xml</suiteXmlFile>
          </suiteXmlFiles>
        </configuration>
        </plugin>
        
 2)In cmd we need to give the below cmd
   " C:\Users\SrinivasCheruku\eclipse-workspace\javatraining\Mavenjave>mvn test -PRegression"
   P stands for profile, and regression is id
   
   
   How do you bring the excel into your testproject(eclipse)
   
  ans: Using Apache poi api
   
   maven dependencies
   
   ans: POI, POI-ooxml
